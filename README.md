**These are the codes from the Google-Kickstart practice sessions**

1. **Practice with candy** - 
 > i ran a loop in the elemnts adding them to sum and then checking how many candies are left after dividing them aming the kids
2. **Centauri prime** -
  > in this i added the vowels in a list or dictionary and searached for the last word if present in the dictionary and then if present made Alice or Bob the king to rule and if the last word ends with "Y" irrespective of the capitalisation then nobody rules.
